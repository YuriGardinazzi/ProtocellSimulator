__TODO__  
* finish completely cell division code (not all species are inherited, doesn't matter for this example because division doesn't happen).
* set _A_ingresso, A_uscita, B_ingresso, B_uscita_ to 0 after division
* create a substance that spread outside the cells and exchange substances with the cell
* finish __MultiplyAllSpecies__
